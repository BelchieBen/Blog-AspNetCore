# Welcome
This is a small blog website that I made to expand my knowlodge about ASP.Net. The website incorprates basic CRUD operations and user authentication (including user roles and permissions).

There is also an admin account which has the authorisation to post new blog posts as well as update and delete those posts. 

# Getting started
Because this project is still in development to use the websote you must download the repository and open it in Visual Studio. From there just run the solution and you can use the website.
